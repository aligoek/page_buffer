# Page Buffer Simulation

A C program simulating a simple page buffer using a doubly linked list. Pages are added, their access count is tracked, and frequently accessed pages (exceeding a threshold) are moved to the front. The buffer has a fixed size, and the least recently added page is removed when full.
